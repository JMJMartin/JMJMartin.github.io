  <pre>Water pollution notes:
What is water pollution? → Water pollution is “defined as the presence in groundwater of toxic chemicals and biological agents”. 

This can pose a “threat to human health and/or the environment”, by causing humans to consume unhealthy substances and pathogens, and by damaging lakes and rivers, hurting the land and the animals who live near the land.

Any amount of pollutants, harmful or not, makes the water polluted.
(10)


What does water pollution cause, and how is it caused? → There are a few major causes of water pollution. At the forefront, we have “urbanization” . This can be physical disturbance of land by construction, chemical pollution from mines and such, and litter, along with a few others. 

There is also deforestation, which is self-explanatory, and can hurt not only the surrounding wild animals, but other humans as well, as there are still many indigenous groups living in the forests that we are cutting down. 

A few others include damming of rivers, and destruction of wetlands.
(9)(6)


How does it affect humans? → Water pollution is especially a problem for “those living in disadvantaged and undeveloped environments” where they are forced to drink unhealthy water

This can lead to horrible diseases such as “cholera, and other serious illnesses such as Guinea worm disease, Typhoid, and Dysentery”.
(8)(2)



How can it be prevented? → It's important to conserve the water we use every day. We can do this by doing things like taking short showers, turning off the tap while brushing teeth, and sharing bathwater.

You should alwasy make sure you are fixing leaks as soon as you find them, and it’s a good idea to “Use water sparingly where watering is necessary and water at night or in the early morning”.
(5)


How does it impact our environment? → Things like acid rain can happen from not only water pollution but also air pollution. As pollutants are put into the air, they can sometimes make their way into rain, “[causing] Acid Rain”. This can hurt our land and also make its way into our water.

Water pollution can also badly hurt farmers, as water pollution can spread to their crops, and they are held liable when their food that they sell is infected or dirty. This can cause a massive hit in sales and health

   	Water is a resource used everyday, and is essential for our survival. Despite being so important to everyday life, not many people know about water management, and how it could be polluted and contaminated. Many people donâ€™t regard that their water that they use could possibly be dirtier than they thought it was, and that their actions might pollute others water. This is why our team feels that more people should understand the consequences of their actions, and about how many people are forced to drink dirtier water.
